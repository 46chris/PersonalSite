                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>23andMe's Bullet Journal was created in a group of nine student developers over the course of ten weeks. 
                        It was created as a solution for organizing college student's hectic schedules. 

                        </p>
                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p> Rarely in life is anybody able to have the luxury of having a single thing to focus and worry about. This holds especially true for college students who have to balance their academic, extracurricular, and career responsibilities while maintaining some semblance of a social life. 
                            <br><br>
                            Handling such a hectic schedule could lead to missed deadlines and hurt one's mental health. The bottom line is, 
                            college students need a way to handle their hectic schedule to healthily tackle their academic and 
                            career-oriented goals.

                    <h3 class="pt-4">Bullet Journal Research</h3>
                    <p> Our first order of action was researching the Bullet Journal domain. After reading through blog posts, lavish product descriptions from companies shilling their online BuJo's, and 
                        insights from a handfule of BuJo users (COVID restrictions), we identified our philosophy and statement of purpose for our app <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Philosophy</b>: A BuJo provides a single place for keeping track of events, tasks, and notes. Rapid logging, the language of the BuJo, makes the content easy to read. A color scheme 
                        and media content makes the space more personal. <br><br>
                        <b>Statement of Purpose</b>: Our project aims to create a digital version of the typically analog bullet journal while maintaining the same level of function and personality.

                    <p class="pt-3"> As a group of 9 inexperienced developers, we thought it best to nail down the essential featuers of our app and then 
                        move onto peripheral features if we had time. Based on what we learned in our preliminary research, we decided that the four features below 
                        were essential to the BuJo experience.

                    <h3>The Harsh Reality of Feasibility</h3>
                    <p class="pt-3"> 
                         I was a part of a group of 4 designers in charge of designing the UI for the BuJo. Our initial designs (below) 
                         contained feautres such as customization of the background, drawing, and complex user statistics. Though we thought 
                         these features made our UI 'look cool' they were wholly unrealistic and much of our low-fi designs had to be scrapped as a result. 
                         On the bright side though, the general look of our pages (side navbar and daily page) remained largely unchanged up through the final 
                         prototype. 
                         <br><br>

                         Although a lot of work was for nothing, this design iteration was a good learning experience. I was reminded that user experience and feasability 
                         must always be balanced. I think that my group was a bit over eager to create an impressive design which made us overlook the fact that 
                         implementing many of these features required far more work than we had time for.

                    <p>
                        In our final iteration of our BuJo design, we decided to present our prototype to our team and professor. Though everybody on the team generally enjoyed 
                        the look and feel of the prototype, our professor told us that the intentions of some pages were unclear and the app as a whole looked far too 'Christmasy'. 
                        Since our professor was the sole stakeholder in this practicum course, we immediately worked to address some of his concerns. 
                        First, we overhauled the theme to a less-diverse color palette as our professor denoted the previous one seemed a bit 'cluttered'. Then, we increased the contrast 
                        on UI elements to make interactable elements clearer for the user. 
                        <br><br>
                        Admittedly, the design overhaul didn't really 'overhaul' the design as much as it could've. This was mainly because coding had to start as soon as possible and we believed 
                        that the design could be reworked as we coded frontend elements. This ended up being impossible given the time crunch and was an important reminder that 
                        designs should be tested outside of the team echo chamber.

                            During one of our weekly meetings, we presented and personas and gave feedback on each other's work. After identifying the best artists and nailing down how we thought our app 
                            should be used, we created these three personas and storyboards.

                            As a whole, I was happy with how the project turned out. This was the first time I've had to implement a server and backend to an app and the 
                            database and authentication services works with minimal bugs even today. Even though a lot of the frontend logic could be optimized and organized 
                            much better, it culminates into a very usable UI with minimal bugs or errors. 
                            <br><br> 

                            If I were to have had a couple more weeks with the project, I'd probably spend most of it redesigning the UI. I think that the blue background seems 
                            a bit overwhelming and the top bar with the logo and profile seems a bit unpolished. Furthermore, the date switcher at the top of the 
                            daily view looks a bit rough and the collapsible side bar's animation and placement is a bit awkward.

                            Nevertheless, this project was an indispensible coding learning experience that really developed my understanding of vanilla Javascript 
                            and server-side coding. It was a great introduction to Agile methodologies which has been invaluable in my internships at 
                            SmartTwigs and United Health Group.
