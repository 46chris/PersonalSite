                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>23andMe's Bullet Journal was created in a group of nine student developers over the course of ten weeks. 
                        It was created as a solution for organizing college student's hectic schedules. 

                        </p>
                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p> Rarely in life is anybody able to have the luxury of having a single thing to focus and worry about. This holds especially true for college students who have to balance their academic, extracurricular, and career responsibilities while maintaining some semblance of a social life. 
                            <br><br>
                            Handling such a hectic schedule could lead to missed deadlines and hurt one's mental health. The bottom line is, 
                            college students need a way to handle their hectic schedule to healthily tackle their academic and 
                            career-oriented goals.

                    <h3 class="pt-4">Bullet Journal Research</h3>
                    <p> Our first order of action was researching the Bullet Journal domain. After reading through blog posts, BuJo product descriptions, and 
                        insights from a handful of BuJo users (COVID restrictions), we articulated our BuJo philosophy which would guide our development decisions. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Philosophy</b>: A BuJo provides a single place for keeping track of events, tasks, and notes. Rapid logging, the language of the BuJo, makes the content easy to read. A color scheme 
                        and media content makes the space more personal.

                    <h3 class="pt-4">User Research</h3>
                    <p>Due to stringent COVID restrictions and a tight course schedule that didn't factor in preliminary user research, we were unable to do thorough user research 
                        into current online BuJo users. We were able to find a handful of users amidst our close family / friends, but much of our findings on pain points with current
                        online BuJo solutions were found after using them ourselves. Some of the most common <b>pain points</b> were: </p>
                        <b><ul class="ms-5">
                            <li>Hard-to-use calendar views (month, week, day)</li>
                            <li>Unintuitive transferable bullets</li>
                            <li>Feature bloat cluttering the UI, necessitating long onboarding process</li>
                        </ul></b>
                    <h4 class="pt-4">Personas</h4>
                    <p>Using what little user research we had, we also created 3 personas to keep us within a user-focused development mindset. </p>

                    <p class="pt-3"> Now that we'd familiarized ourselves with the domain and common issues in it, we began planning our development cycle.
                        Because we all had limited development experience, we thought it best to implement the essential functionalities of a BuJo before 
                        moving onto any extra features. 
                        <br><br>
                        Based on the philosophy we defined, we decided that a mood tracker, transferable bullets, multiple 
                        calendar views, and 3 different bullet types were enough to capture the essence of a BuJo. To address the pain points we found during user research,
                        we limited features to keep our app simple and elected to implement drag-and-droppable bullets to make transferring bullets as intuitive 
                        as possible.

                    <h3>The Harsh Reality of Feasibility</h3>
                    <p class="pt-3"> 
                         I was a part of a group of 4 designers in charge of designing the UI for the BuJo. Our initial designs (below) 
                         contained feautres such as customization of the background, drawing, and complex user statistics. Though we thought 
                         these features made our UI 'look cool' they were wholly unrealistic and much of our low-fi designs had to be scrapped as a result. 
                         On the bright side, the general look of our pages (side navbar and daily page) remained largely unchanged up through the final 
                         prototype. Although a lot of work was for nothing, this design process was a good learning experience.

                        In the final iteration of our BuJo design, we presented our prototype to our team and professor. Though the team enjoyed 
                        the look of the prototype, our professor felt that the pages' intentions were often unclear and the app looked far too 'Christmasy'. 
                        Since our professor was the sole stakeholder in this practicum course, we had no choice but to overhaul our designs.
                        First, we switched the theme to a less-diverse color palette, then increased the contrast 
                        on UI elements to make interactable elements clearer for the user.

                        Admittedly, the design 'overhaul' didnt' change much of the existing design. We were strapped for time and had to begin coding. We also believed 
                        that the design could be reworked as we coded frontend elements. This ended up being impossible given the time crunch and was an important reminder that 
                        designs should be tested outside of the team echo chamber.

                            As a whole, I was happy with how the project turned out.
                            The database and authentication services works with minimal bugs. 
                            Even though a lot of the frontend logic could be optimized and organized 
                            better, it culminates into a very usable UI without glaring errors. 
                            <br><br> 

                            If I were to have had a couple more weeks with the project, I'd probably spend most of it redesigning the UI. I think the blue background is 
                            a bit overwhelming and the top bar's aesthetic and logo is a bit unpolished. Furthermore, the date switcher at the top of the 
                            daily view looks out of place and the collapsible side bar's animation/placement is awkward. 
                            <br><br>

                            Nevertheless, this project was an indispensible learning experience that developed my understanding of vanilla Javascript 
                            and server-side coding. It was a great introduction to Agile methodologies which has been invaluable in my internships at 
                            SmartTwigs and United Health Group.
