                    <p> From here, we moved onto identifying the core features of our app. So similar to our sessions brainstorming 
                        the purpose of the app, we began by listing every feature we thought a group-making-travel app should have. After 
                        group voting and discussion, we decided our MVP should have these features:

                            <li>A friend list and group list (each trip will be organized by "group")</li>

                            <li>A chat room and voting room in each group</li>
                            <li>A voting system where each group member leaves some sort of rating on each activity in a group's prospective 
                                activity list. 
                            </li>

                        required less on-boarding in comparison to similar apps such as planmesh and eezy. And focused more on facilitating accessible group 
                        discussion in comparison to Tripadvisor, Google, or Trello.

                    <p> Overall, I think it was beneficial to focus on the nature/size of the group using our app in our storyboards.
                        Keeping the nature of different group dynamics at the forefront of our user-based development ended up shaping 
                        much of our UI/UX choices during the mockup and prototyping phase. <br></br>
                        
                        The actual drawings in the storyboards however could've had more facial expressions and development of the use cases. 
                        Just by looking at the art, there are too many frames with just the app and the lack of guiding signs (such as arrows)
                        makes the storyboard visually confusing. I think we were too eager to start developing the app and turned the storyboard 
                        more of a UI brainstorm rather than a use case brainstorm.

                        bottom row of photos was the imagined user flow for searching for an event, adding into a group, and 
                        then voting on it in the group. I was personally in charge of the search screen, of which I modeled after

                    <p> Creating the mockup was a messy process because we failed to elaborate past our initial brainstorm of our MVP and just 
                        haphazardly jumped onto Figma together. Everybody had their own idea of what the app should look like and contain which made 
                        our first drafts extremely incoherent. 
                        <br><br> 
    
                        After hours of essentially going nowhere, I suggested we take a step back and identify the specific pages the app should have. 
                        From there, we chose an icon package to keep our icons consistent and tackled each page as a group to ensure that 
                        everything was coherent. 
    
                        <br><br> In the future, I would definitely run a group meeting identifying the specific pages we need to mockup before actually creating it. 
                        Furthermore, I think it would help the cohesiveness of the mockup to either tackle each page as a group or create some 
                        rudimentary style guide to keep everything consistent.

                        <p class="pt-3"> Altogether, I was happy with the work my group was able to accomplish in a five week summer quarter that was conducted completely 
                            online. <br><br>
    
                            If we had more time, I would've done a lot more user testing. The little user testing that we were able to do was 
                            organized by the professor and was limited to the other groups within our class. Despite this, we gained valuable information 
                            into how our app should look and function and the feedback largely carried the design changes we made from the mockup to the 
                            final prototype. <br></br> 
    
                            As for myself, the biggest takeaway from this experience was to not underestimate the importance of getting to know your teammates. 
                            In previous projects, my relationships with teammates was limited to whatever we talked about for work and in meetings. During my time on 
                            Onwards, I got to know my teammates and relate to them on things outside of the app. I felt that this made us more honest with each other 
                            during feedback sessions and made the meetings much more enjoyable to be a part of.
