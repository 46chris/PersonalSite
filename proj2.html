                    <h3>Defining the Product</h3>
                    <p class="pt-3"> During the first meeting with the client, I aimed to define the key features of his website. 
                        As he is still a student, he emphasized that the site must contain a contact form and make his socials easily 
                        accessible. Aside from that, we added an about page as that is the standard-fare for these portfolio sites. 
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="pt-4">Mood / Flair</h4>
                    <p>The client was unsure on what kind of atmosphere and flair he wanted on his site. To give him some ideas, 
                        I compiled others' portfolio sites and presented it to him to see if there was any layout, color scheme, or design 
                        choices he liked. Unfortunately, this didn't change much and he suggested I make the website as simple and plain 
                        as possible. I stupidly listened and did just that. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="row medWrap py-5"> 
                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p> After looking at the simplest of the reference sites, I went to Figma to prototype his website. 
                        I created three layouts all adhering to a monochromatic color scheme to keep in line with his wishes for a 
                        simple site and ensure that his artwork was the focal point of the site. 
                    </p>

                <div class="row widest mx-auto">
                    <img class="w-100" src="imgs/joeArtPort/Prototype.PNG">
                </div>
                <div class="row medWrap py-5"> 
                    <p>So I set up a meeting and presented these layouts to the client. He said he enjoyed the simple look of his site 
                        and began to pick and choose elements he liked from each one. He said he liked the layout of the art from options 
                        1 and 3 (leftmost and rightmost layouts), the about section of option 1 (leftmost), the navbar of options 1 and 2 (leftmost and 
                        middle), and the color scheme used in option 1 (leftmost). Using his feedback, I began creating the final prototype. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="pt-4"> Final Prototype</h4>
                    <p>Ultimately, I chose to go for a single page website to adhere to the client's wishes of a simple site. Other than that, I just 
                        took out the pieces he enjoyed from the previous prototypes and made this one

                    <h3>First Deployment</h3> 
                    <p>Because this was just going to be a static webpage with little changes in the future, I chose to deploy the site on 
                        github pages (also it's free and I'm broke).

                    <h5>Learning</h5>
                    <p>My biggest issue with this website was overengineering. I don't know if it was because I was just coming off of finishing 
                        developing an app for a class or I was just extra paranoid but I was so obsessed with optimizing the speed of the website. 
                        I tested all the different ways to instantiate the images on the DOM in order to figure out which was the fastest when in reality, 
                        it really didn't make a difference. <br><br>
                        I also devoted far too much time trying to make the website as future-proof as possible. This entailed trying to find all the "backendless" (without backend cause github pages doesn't support it)
                        ways to make adding in future art pieces as painless as possible. Without going into detail, this was also a waste of time considering that simply
                        adding in the image to the repo and then adding in an img tag to the html took < 1 minute. 
                    </p>
                </div> 

                <div class="row medWrap mx-auto py-5"> 
                    <h3>Second Deployment</h3>
                    <p class="pb-4">The client ended up being happy with the first deployment. I was not. The page was far too dull and I thought, was doing a 
                        disservice to his artwork. So I offered to program a new site for him at no extra cost. If he didn't like the new one, 
                        I told him he could simply keep the old one. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Redesign </h4>
                    <p>It isn't good practice, but seeing as though I had a good idea of what I wanted his new site to look like, I just went straight to coding it up. <br><br>
                        My biggest gripe with the first site was the ugly navbar at the top so I decided to change it for a side navigation bar with a "logo" that I designed myself 
                        utilizing some of his older art pieces as the background. I also lightened the color scheme because the black seemed too dreary. Finally, I
                        opted for a multi-page site because it kept everything organized and opened up the possibility to give the site a bit more personality. <br><br>

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>My biggest takeaways with this project was to always take what the client wants with a grain of salt and to not overengineer things. 
                        Despite recognizing that what the client wanted would look sub-par, I created the site anyways because I thought it best not to question 
                        what the client wants. After redesigning the site and seeing the client much happier with a layout that I thought would look better, I learned that 
                        my opinion as a developer holds weight and shouldn't always be ignored in favor of the client's. As for over-engineering, I think this stems from 
                        my naturally anxious personality. I'm sure that as a I learn more about the ins and outs of web development, this will get better. 
                        <br><br>
                        As a whole though, I'm happy with how my first client's site turned out and can't wait to start on more.
