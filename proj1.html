                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>"Onwards" was an app idea created for a summer-quarter-long project in COGS 187A. The assignment's theme 
                            was travel and the final deliverable was a prototype that was to be created in groups of 6. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p> Whether it be in groups of friends, family, or a significant other, it's often difficult to agree upon 
                            an activity or place to eat. Usually, we follow whatever the most vocal individuals decide on or just settle for 
                            Google's top decision. <br><br> Though this can work out fine, we wanted to create an app that would take everybody's
                            preferences into consideration and find the optimal activity or place to eat for each group.

                    <h3>Team Creation</h3>
                    <p class="pt-3 ">The quarter was still completely online so I had to get to know everybody through their lifeless Zoom profile pictures. 
                        After our brief and awkward introductions, our first order of business in our five-week endeavor was deciding on a team name. Initially, I didn't 
                        think too much of it. But after an hour of throwing names at each other, it became a valuable opportunity to learn 
                        about my group mates' personalities and sense of humor. We ended up settling on "Keyboard Kowboys"
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="pt-4">Logo ideation</h4>
                    <p class="pt-3"> Our first weekly meeting was spent creating our team's logo. We were all tasked with creating three sketches which we would subsequently present to our groupmates
                        for feedback. <br><br> 
                        My logos from left to right (or top to bottom)
                        <ol class="mx-auto px-5 mb-4">
                            <li> I wanted this logo to have a friendly feel so I modeled a macintosh like BMO from 
                                "Adventure Time"</li>
                            <li>I used an old macintosh and put our group's initials on the screen. My thought process was first identifying 
                                items related to a keyboard (computer) and then used a retro version of it because retro items are popular right now.</li>
                            <li>In this case, I tried to make a logo which resembled that of a sports team. Followingly, I used a cowboy as our mascot
                                and tried to make some symmetrical design with our initials. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <div class="col-12 col-sm-7">
                        <p>I chose to finalize my third logo because my groupmates' feedback indicated it had the most potential. I firstly incorporated 
                            the initials into the cowboy's face because my groupmates suggested the initial design looked too separated. Then I polished the look 
                            on the cowboy and finalized the shading.

                        <p>The team eventually decided on this logo which was made by Ivan Luu. I too enjoyed the cutesy nature 
                            of the logo and I thought the use of the key, cowboy hat, and bandana were good visualizations for our team name: 
                            Keyboard Kowboys.

                        I suggested we list different pain points associated with travelling. The one that resonated 
                        most with the team was the painstaking process of deciding on what to do when travelling in a group.

                    <p> From here, we moved onto identifying the core features of our app. So similar to our sessions brainstorming 
                        the purpose of the app, we began by listing every feature we thought a group-making-travel app should have. After 
                        group voting and discussion, we decided our MVP should have these features: 
                        <ul class="proj1Ul">
                            <li>A friend list and group list (each trip will be organized by "group")</li>
                            <li>Group creation </li>
                            <li>A chat room and voting room in each group</li>
                            <li>A voting system where each group member leaves some sort of rating on each activity in a group's prospective 
                                activity list. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Ability to search for activities and places to eat and then add into a group's voting list</li>
                            <li>Ability to leave ratings and reviews on activities and places to eat</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p> A groupmate and I were in charge of the competitor analysis. We figured that Onwards would be most successful if it 
                        required less on-boarding in comparison to similar apps such as planmesh and eezy. And focused more on facilitating accessible group 
                        discussion in comparison to Tripadvisor, Google, or Trello.

                    <p> Overall, I think it was beneficial to focus on the nature/size of the group using our app in our storyboards.
                        Keeping the nature of different group dynamics at the forefront of our user-based development ended up shaping 
                        much of our UI/UX choices during the mockup and prototyping phase. <br></br>
                        
                        The actual drawings in the storyboards however could've had more facial expressions and development of the use cases. 
                        Just by looking at the art, there are too many frames with just the app and the lack of guiding signs (such as arrows)
                        makes the storyboard visually confusing. I think we were too eager to start developing the app and turned the storyboard 
                        more of a UI brainstorm rather than a use case brainstorm.

                    <p class="pt-3">The four main tabs of the app were home, search, friends, and profile. The top row of photos was what we 
                        imagined would be the flow for a user getting on the app and creating a group for their next trip. The 
                        bottom row of photos was the imagined user flow for searching for an event, adding into a group, and 
                        then voting on it in the group. I was personally in charge of the search screen, of which I modeled after 
                        "AllTrails" and "Yelp"

                    <p> Creating the mockup was a messy process because we failed to elaborate past our initial brainstorm of our MVP and just 
                        haphazardly jumped onto Figma together. Everybody had their own idea of what the app should look like and contain which made 
                        our first drafts extremely incoherent. 
                        <br><br> 
    
                        After hours of essentially going nowhere, I suggested we take a step back and identify the specific pages the app should have. 
                        From there, we chose an icon package to keep our icons consistent and tackled each page as a group to ensure that 
                        everything was coherent. 
    
                        <br><br> In the future, I would definitely run a group meeting identifying the specific pages we need to mockup before actually creating it. 
                        Furthermore, I think it would help the cohesiveness of the mockup to either tackle each page as a group or create some 
                        rudimentary style guide to keep everything consistent.

                        <p class="pt-3"> Altogether, I was happy with the work my group was able to accomplish in a five week summer quarter that was conducted completely 
                            online. <br><br>
    
                            If we had more time, I would've done a lot more user testing. The little user testing that we were able to do was 
                            organized by the professor and was limited to the other groups within our class. Despite this, we gained valuable information 
                            into how our app should look and function and the feedback largely carried the design changes we made from the mockup to the 
                            final prototype. <br></br> 
    
                            As for myself, the biggest takeaway from this experience was to not underestimate the importance of getting to know your teammates. 
                            In previous projects, my relationships with teammates was limited to whatever we talked about for work and in meetings. During my time on 
                            Onwards, I got to know my teammates and relate to them on things outside of the app. I felt that this made us more honest with each other 
                            during feedback sessions and made the meetings much more enjoyable to be a part of.
