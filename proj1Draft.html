                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>"Onwards" is an app design created in a group of 6 students over the course of 5 weeks. It's an 
                            activity-finding and decision-facilitating travel-based app. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p> Groups of travelers planning out their itinerary need a way to facilitate group discussion because 
                            it can be hard to voice individual opinions, especially when some are not as social as their peers.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        <p> Imagine it's your last day vacationing with your friends in Hawaii. You've always wanted to visit the Byodo-In temple 
                            but the outspoken leader of the group has swayed the group to laze on the beach. You think some people would prefer to 
                            visit Byodo-In but are unsure. This is where Onwards comes in. With anonymous voting on a centralized list of potential 
                            destinations, Onwards easily surveys each individual's preferences to help your group make the optimal decision on your next outing.

                    <p class="pt-3"> 
                        With only five weeks to fully flesh out our app, my group went straight into identifying any pain points related 
                        to traveling. We quickly identified two major ones that all 6 of us identified with
                        <ul class="ms-5">
                            <li>Finding attractions the align with our interests</li>
                            <li>Creating an itinerary everybody is happy with when traveling in a group</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="pt-3">
                        After identifying the two pain points, we looked for apps built to solve these issues to get a feel for what 
                        was already on the market. The four that we thought were most similar to what we were envisioning for Onwards were
                        Citysocializer, Planmesh, Peatix, and Mesh.

                        Some apps were catered specifically to simplifying planning when planning in groups, whereas others were meant 
                        for solely suggesting activities to do. None had both features integrated onto the same platform.

                    <p> From here, we moved onto identifying the core features of our app. We began by listing every feature we thought a 
                        group-making-travel app should have. After group voting and discussion, we decided our MVP should have these features: 
                        <ul class="ms-5 proj1Ul">
                            <li>A friend list and group list (each trip will be organized by "group")</li>
                            <li>Group creation </li>
                            <li>A chat room and voting room in each group</li>
                            <li>A voting system where each group member leaves some sort of rating on each activity in a group's prospective 
                                activity list. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Ability to search for activities and places to eat and then add into a group's voting list</li>
                            <li>Ability to leave ratings and reviews on activities and places to eat</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4 class="pb-3">Competitor Analysis</h4>
                    <p> A groupmate and I were in charge of the competitor analysis. After identifying core features of similar apps and the general UX, we figured that 
                        Onwards would be most successful if it <b>required minimal on-boarding</b>. Similar apps such as Planmesh and Eezy had lengthy onboarding processes 
                        that in our opinion, would divert users away from ever using their services because of the high upfront cost. We also wanted Onwards to <b>focus 
                        primarily on facilitating group decision making </b> while maintaining the search capabilities of apps such as Tripadvisor and Google.

                        <p class="pt-3">Every group member was reponsible for creating three personas and a corresponding story board. The personas I created consisted of a couple, group of friends, and an individual. 
                            These three personas were created based on the decision-facilitating and activity-finding capabilities of Onwards. The group and couple were meant to represent
                            the most common use case for Onwards where groups can find and decide upon an activity through Onward's main flow. The individual on the other hand represents a less-common 
                            use case and mainly portrays the activity-finding capabilities of the app.

                    <p> Overall, I think it was beneficial to focus on the nature/size of the group using our app in our storyboards.
                        Keeping the nature of different group dynamics at the forefront of our user-based development ended up shaping 
                        much of our UI/UX choices during the mockup and prototyping phase. <br></br>
                        
                        The actual drawings in the storyboards however could've incorporated more of personas and focused less on the 
                        screens within the app. There are too many frames with just the app and the lack of guiding signs (such as arrows)
                        makes the storyboard visually confusing. I think this was the case because we were too eager to start developing the app 
                        and turned the storyboard into a UI brainstorm rather than a use case brainstorm.

                        imagined would be the flow for a user getting on the app and creating a group for their next trip. The 
                        bottom row of photos was the imagined user flow for searching for an event, adding into a group, and 
                        then voting on it in the group. I was personally in charge of the search screen, of which I modeled after 
                        "AllTrails" and "Yelp"

                    <p> Creating the mockup was a messy process because we failed to elaborate past our initial brainstorm of our MVP and just 
                        haphazardly jumped onto Figma together. Everybody had their own idea of what the app should look like and contain which made 
                        our first drafts extremely incoherent. 
                        <br><br> 
    
                        After hours of essentially going nowhere, I suggested we take a step back and identify the specific pages the app should have. 
                        From there, we chose an icon package to keep our icons consistent and tackled each page as a group to ensure that 
                        everything was coherent. 
    
                        <br><br> In the future, I would definitely run a group meeting identifying the specific pages we need to mockup before actually creating it. 
                        Furthermore, I think it would help the cohesiveness of the mockup to either tackle each page as a group or create some 
                        rudimentary style guide to keep everything consistent.

                        <p class="pt-3"> Altogether, I was happy with the work my group was able to accomplish in a five week summer quarter that was conducted completely 
                            online. <br><br>
    
                            If we had more time, I would've done a lot more user testing. The little user testing that we were able to do was 
                            organized by the professor and was limited to the other groups within our class. Despite this, we gained valuable information 
                            into how our app should look and function and the feedback largely carried the design changes we made from the mockup to the 
                            final prototype. <br></br> 
    
                            As for myself, the biggest takeaway from this experience was to not underestimate the importance of getting to know your teammates. 
                            In previous projects, my relationships with teammates was limited to whatever we talked about for work and in meetings. During my time on 
                            Onwards, I got to know my teammates and relate to them on things outside of the app. I felt that this made us more honest with each other 
                            during feedback sessions and made the meetings much more enjoyable to be a part of.
